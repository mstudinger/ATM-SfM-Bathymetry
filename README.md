# Structure from Motion (SfM) Bathymetry
This repository contains tools for deriving supraglacial lake bathymetry from ATM aerial imagery using the Ames Stereo Pipeline ([ASP](https://stereopipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)).

Jupyter notebooks:
* Conversion of CAMBOTv2 L0 natural-color (RGB) images to single-channel grayscale (luminance) images for use with ASP.
* Conversion of CAMBOTv2 GPS antenna positions to the camera's focal plane position for use with ASP.
